# Memory Game Project by Thais Pulliam
##Features that the game might contain:
* Counter for How Many Tries.</li>
* Counter for How Many Pairs found.
* Counter for How Many Wins (?) 
* Reload Page (with a button) without Refresing.
* Reload Page Automatically if game is won. 
* Set a Winning Page.

##To consider when setting up the logic:
* A pair of same cards is needed. 
* Game will be set with 20 cards (10 pairs).
* The cards need to be shuffled into new positions for every new game. 
* When Pairs are found, desapear their cards. 
* How will the pairs will be determinated (matches), to see if the pairs is a "win".

##How this Project will be planned:
*Sketch hand-written wireframes are found very helpful to me, thus I will be using a lot of images of those sketches in the README Document, to keep track of my logic and line of thought during all steps of the project. 
* Most important Highlights will be typed in as well to be kept on track.
